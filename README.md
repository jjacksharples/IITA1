Interests in IT:

My interest in IT began at a young age with our first computer using PC DOS 2000. It was mostly just fascination and gaming back then. As the years have progressed IT has always been there in most aspects of life, be it education, socialising with friends, or personal interests.

The particular moment that made me decided to get more involved in the IT world and seek it as a career is all recent revelations with COVID-19 happening and seeing the opportunity to up skill and secure my place in a job in the future.

I chose RMIT mostly because its what was offered by Open University Australia, but also my housemate attended there and had nothing but praise. Also Technology is in the name so how could I go wrong.

What do you expect to learn during your studies?
I am not entirely sure what I want out of my studies just yet, I am hoping to learn and discover that as I progress through the course. At the end of my studies I hope to be job ready and armed with knowledge and techniques that give me an edge in the industry.
