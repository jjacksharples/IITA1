Interests in IT:

My interest in IT began at a young age with our first computer using PC DOS 2000. It was mostly just fascination and gaming back then. As the years have progressed IT has always been there in most aspects of life, be it education, socialising with friends, or personal interests.

The particular moment that made me decided to get more involved in the IT world and seek it as a career is all recent revelations with COVID-19 happening and seeing the opportunity to up skill and secure my place in a job in the future.

I chose RMIT mostly because its what was offered by Open University Australia, but also my housemate attended there and had nothing but praise. Also Technology is in the name so how could I go wrong.

What do you expect to learn during your studies?
I am not entirely sure what I want out of my studies just yet, I am hoping to learn and discover that as I progress through the course. At the end of my studies I hope to be job ready and armed with knowledge and techniques that give me an edge in the industry.

I am not really sure what I want careerwise exactly, but I am currentky enoying my Introduction to Programming so I have investigated a software development career.
In this role I would be incharge of design, development and implementation of various programs. A particular aspect of this job that i find interesting is the
ability to work from home.
Areas that you would need to be proficient in would be  various software languages, for this job in particular; NET, C#, Node.JS, WPF, Entity Framework. Another core skill that would bve required would be the ability to lead and work in. teams, espcially when it comes to working remote as you will need to be able to liase and organise the teams/clients you are leading to get tasks complete at a high level of proficency. 
I currently have some expertise in leadership and working in teams from my career in hospitality but how that will translate into a new industry could prove to be a challange as you are working with lots different people in lots of different locations.
I plan to aquire most of these skill through this degreee but also to continue after study through self-learning on various languages as there are so many of them in thihs dynamic industry.

Personal Profile

Myer-Briggs Test - The Debater ENTP
A Debater (ENTP) is a person with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter.
This means I am able to thhink quickly on my feet and comw up with origan al ideas which could be hugely benefical when it comes to writing computer software. Although on the downside i can be argumentative and insensitive to others which isnt great nesescarily in a team environment.

Learning style Test - Pragmatist style learner
Being a pragmatist style learner means that I like to see how things are applied to real life scenarios so theorising can seem a bit pointless without an action. I I like to act quickly and confidently on ideas, getting straight to the point, and may lose patience with lengthy discussions.

Big 5 Factors
[image of reults]
After taking the big 5 factors test I am able to see that I am outgoing and open which is useful when working with teams with my high score in Factor I and that need to work on round out my ideas and put more thought into ideas before rushing into them, as seen with the low Factor IV score.
